# REACTION

## A startup repo for Universal-React

This repository's purpose is the education of the author. I am looking for feedback on it so feel free to share your knowledge. Use at your own risk.

## Technologies

### Heroku? Openshift? (TODO)

Open for debate. May simply not include deployment tools.

### Node (DONE)

Well... no comment.

### NPM scripts (DONE)

I am a fan of NPM scripts. I might rework them a little.

### Express (DONE)

I only use this to launch a very simple server, looking for ways to delete this dependency.

### React (DONE)

Well... no comment.

### Redux with Immutable (TODO)

May look to include, but still to be decided.

### React Router (DONE)

May be time to look for alternatives.

### MobX (TODO)

On a different repo (or branch) without Redux.

### Webpack (with hot reload) (DONE)

Mostly interested in feedback on this. The current config is a mix of thing that I had in Webpack 3 ported over to webpack 4. It works but might be miles away from logical.

### CSS / SCSS / Styled Components (TODO)

Still trying to figure out what to do with style.

### Testing (TODO)

Chai, Jest... probably the later.

### Eslint (DONE)

Love my linter.

### API access with axios (TODO)

Not sure if I'll include, just to keep is simple.

#### BigPipe (TOPLAY)

I wish. XD.
